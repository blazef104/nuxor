# Nuxor - Number XOR

Simple python script to generate an image by XORing the numbers in the given range. Also an exercise to see if i can still write code.

No fancy numpy arrays are used. Just basic stuff to keep the code as simple as possible.

The idea comes from the reddit user [u/gerdyw1](reddit.com/u/gerdyw1) and his post in [r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/8gltik/3d_plot_of_the_bitwise_xor_of_integers_32_to_32/)

This is the result using the range [-31,31) :
